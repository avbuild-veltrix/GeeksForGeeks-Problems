# Prime Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a number  **n**, determine whether it is a  **prime number**  or not.
 **Note:**  A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Examples :
**

```
Input: n = 7
Output: true
Explanation: 7 has exactly two divisors: 1 and 7, making it a prime number.
```

```
Input: n = 25
Output: false
Explanation: 25 has more than two divisors: 1, 5, and 25, so it is not a prime number.
```

```
Input: n = 1
Output: false
Explanation: 1 has only one divisor (1 itself), which is not sufficient for it to be considered prime.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 109

## Solution

**Language:** C++

```cpp
 class Solution {
 public:
     bool isPrime(int n) {
         if (n <= 1)
             return false;

         for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
             if (n % i == 0)
                 return false;
         }

         return true;
     }
 };
```
